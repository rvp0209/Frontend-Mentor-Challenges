Sršen used her background as an artist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\n","\n","By 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available through a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company has invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital marketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and consistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google Display Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.\n","\n","# Business Task\n","\n","Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat's available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.\n","\n","There are three important questions that Urška Sršen is asking to be considered:\n","\n","1.  What are some trends in smart device usage?\n","\n","2.  How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n","\n","3.  How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n","\n","# Source\n","\n","The original data comes from [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users' habits.\n","\n","# Preparation\n","\n","There are 18 total files:\n","\n","-   dailyActivity_merged.csv\n","-   dailyCalories_merged.csv\n","-   dailyIntensities_merged.csv\n","-   dailySteps_merged.csv\n","-   heartrate_seconds_merged.csv\n","-   hourlyCalories_merged.csv\n","-   hourlyIntensities_merged.csv\n","-   hourlySteps_merged.csv\n","-   minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv\n","-   minuteCaloriesWide_merged.csv\n","-   minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv\n","-   minuteIntensitiesWide_merged.csv\n","-   minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv\n","-   minuteSleep_merged.csv\n","-   minuteStepsNarrow_merged.csv\n","-   minuteStepsWide_merged.csv\n","-   sleepDay_merged.csv weightLogInfo_merged.csv\n","\n","### Pre-Cleaning\n","\n","The data was all first loaded into and quickly examined using Google Sheets. I used the function COUNTUNIQUE to determine the exact number of participants in each dataset.\n","\n","Since 'dailyActivity_merged' already contains all of the same information as 'dailyCalories_merged', 'dailyIntensities_merged', and 'dailySteps_merged', only 'dailyActivity_merged' will be used.\n","\n","There is not enough information to consider any overall trends by the minute as there is only narrow calorie data, so it will not be used. Similarly, weight log info only contains data from eight unique participants, therefore it can also be excluded in this analysis as the small sample may skew the results one way or another.\n","\n","Likewise, daily sleep does not include the same number of participants (there are only 24 compared to the 33 in the 'hourly' and 'daily' datasets) as the 'hourly' and 'daily activity' logs and may taint the results of the analysis.\n","\n","For the hourly data, 'hourlyCalories_merged', 'hourlyIntensities_merged and 'hourlySteps_merged' all contained the exact same ID and Activity Date information. These were small enough sets that this could be done manually without any extra effort. I combined the step total from 'hourlySteps_merged' and intensity columns from 'hourlyIntensities_merged' into the spreadsheet 'hourlyCalories_merged' using the IMPORTRANGE function.\n","\n","I have retained unaltered copies of the original data on my computer if needed for further analysis.\n","\n","### Libraries\n","\n","The following libraries were loaded to help with analysis."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"e792f80b","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-05T13:40:30.301946Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-05T13:40:30.299563Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-05T13:40:31.811289Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-05T13:40:31.809249Z"},"papermill":{"duration":1.524976,"end_time":"2023-10-05T13:40:31.814484","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-05T13:40:30.289508","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["── \u001b[1mAttaching core tidyverse packages\u001b[22m ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n","\u001b[32m✔\u001b[39m \u001b[34mdplyr    \u001b[39m 1.1.2     \u001b[32m✔\u001b[39m \u001b[34mreadr    \u001b[39m 2.1.4\n","\u001b[32m✔\u001b[39m \u001b[34mforcats  \u001b[39m 1.0.0     \u001b[32m✔\u001b[39m \u001b[34mstringr  \u001b[39m 1.5.0\n","\u001b[32m✔\u001b[39m \u001b[34mggplot2  \u001b[39m 3.4.2     \u001b[32m✔\u001b[39m \u001b[34mtibble   \u001b[39m 3.2.1\n","\u001b[32m✔\u001b[39m \u001b[34mlubridate\u001b[39m 1.9.2     \u001b[32m✔\u001b[39m \u001b[34mtidyr    \u001b[39m 1.3.0\n","\u001b[32m✔\u001b[39m \u001b[34mpurrr    \u001b[39m 1.0.1     \n","── \u001b[1mConflicts\u001b[22m ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n","\u001b[31m✖\u001b[39m \u001b[34mdplyr\u001b[39m::\u001b[32mfilter()\u001b[39m masks \u001b[34mstats\u001b[39m::filter()\n","\u001b[31m✖\u001b[39m \u001b[34mdplyr\u001b[39m::\u001b[32mlag()\u001b[39m    masks \u001b[34mstats\u001b[39m::lag()\n","\u001b[36mℹ\u001b[39m Use the conflicted package (\u001b[3m\u001b[34m<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>\u001b[39m\u001b[23m) to force all conflicts to become errors\n","\n","Attaching package: ‘janitor’\n","\n","\n","The following objects are masked from ‘package:stats’:\n","\n","    chisq.test, fisher.test\n","\n","\n","here() starts at /kaggle/working\n","\n"]}],"source":["library(tidyverse)\n","library(dplyr)\n","library(tidyr)\n","library(skimr)\n","library(janitor)\n","library(here)\n","library(ggplot2)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"77aea67d","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.00851,"end_time":"2023-10-05T13:40:31.832776","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-10-05T13:40:31.824266","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Methodology - Part 1\n","\n","With the packages and libraries loaded, I can now begin cleansing and analysis.\n","\n","### Daily Average\n","\n","Before starting analysis, I decided to rename the data frames to something easier to work with.

sums up the individual averages.\n","\n","### Analaysis - Part 1: Daily Activity\n","\n","By examining the average, it's easy to get a big picture idea of how often participants were moving every day. User 8877689391 walked the most steps on average with 16040 steps taken daily over the course of the two months from which the data was captured. As a whole, the 30 participants walked nearly 7638 steps each day. Based on this, it seems like each user was pretty active throughout the course of the day.\n","\n","But, the sedentary minutes give us a different picture. User 1927972279 was sedentary on average for 1317 minutes. As a group, the participants were sedentary for 991 minutes. This indicates that the FitBit users from this study are not very active throughout the day.\n","\n","\"Active minutes\" are not defined so it's hard to say what that means. But, when combining sedentary minutes and steps, it seems that users are probably getting steps in through typical daily activity (i.e. running errands) without necessarily exercising. Examining the hourly and intensity data can give better insight to this.\n","\n","# Methodology - Part 2\n","\n","The hourly information gives a more detailed snapshot than the daily data.

Conclusion\n","\n","Urška Sršen requested these three questions be kept in mind during analysis:\n","\n","1.  **What are some trends in smart device usage?**\n","\n","-   Users were fairly sedentary throughout the day, even if they were accomplishing the majority of their \"exercise\" through typical daily routine. Step totals ranged from 337.16 at the high end to 19.29 at the low end on average per hour. Cumulatively, users managed between 916 and 16040 steps on average per day. As a group, the users completed 7637.91 steps daily and 160.08 hourly.\n","\n","-   Given how many steps some users managed to get in some days, they're likely not engaging in conscious, purposeful exercise except once per day.\n","\n","2.  **How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?**\n","\n","-   Bellabeat already has a fantastic product that can help users with goal setting and stress management. But sometimes people need a push. With Bellabeat's bio-response tracking, users can get even more in tuned with their bodies through helpful reminders on their watch or on the app that can encourage users to move more throughout the day and achieve their goals.\n","\n","3.  **How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?**\n","\n","-   The [Center for Disease Control recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm) at least \"150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity\" each week. Push notifications are a great way to remind users to get up and get moving. Targeted exercises can change with how well users are or are not meeting their goals and premium users can tap intoeven more personalized coaching with awareness of how much more exercise they're getting. With menstrual cycle and heart rate tracking, push notifications can be helpful reminders to get blood flowing, which can improve mood and overall physical health.\n","\n","# Appendix\n","\n","##
